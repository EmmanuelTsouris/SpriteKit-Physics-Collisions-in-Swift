# SpriteKit Physics Collisions in Swift

I originally wrote this to learn Swift 1.x. I've since updated and cleaned it up for Swift 2.x and Xcode 7.

The code and architecture based on the original Objective-C [SpriteKit Physics Collisions](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/samplecode/SpriteKit_Physics_Collisions/Introduction/Intro.html) sample from Apple.

## Player Controls

* w or forward arrow :  accelerate forward
* a or left arrow    :  turn left
* d or right arrow   :  turn right
* s or back arrow    :  accelerate backwards
* space bar          :  fire a missile
* r                  :  reset the simulation
