# SpriteKit Physics Collisions in Swift

I originally wrote this to learn Swift 1.x. Recently, I updated and cleaned it up for Swift 2.x and Xcode 7.

It's based on the original Objective-C [SpriteKit Physics Collisions sample from Apple](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/samplecode/SpriteKit_Physics_Collisions/Introduction/Intro.html):
========================================================

The example spawns two ships, one is under player control, the other can be used as a target:

*w or forward arrow :  accelerate forward
*a or left arrow    :  turn left
*d or right arrow   :  turn right
*s or back arrow    :  accelerate backwards
*space bar          :  fire a missile
*r                  :  reset the simulation
